# Lacona Addon Documentation

Lacona is built from the ground up to support custom Addons.
The addon API is very powerful - all of the built-in Lacona commands
are constructed from the same tools. Custom Addons can make use of
user configuration, access the internet and the file system, run
Applescript, query Spotlight, and much more.

In addition to building brand-new Commands, Addons can also extend existing
commands, both built-in and custom. This creates an immensely powerful system.

Commands are written in Javascript, and are deployed on `npm`. Try it
for yourself!
