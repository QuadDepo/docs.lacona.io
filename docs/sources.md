# Sources

Sources provide a way to fetch external information into Lacona phrases,
while still keeping `describe` calls fast and pure.

They are based on
[`elliptical-observe`](https://github.com/brandonhorst/elliptical-observe).

To work with sources, you need to have a basic understanding of
[Observables](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable). Your life
will be easier if you use
[ReactiveX/rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS).

More docs to come. For now, please see [examples](docs/examples.md).
